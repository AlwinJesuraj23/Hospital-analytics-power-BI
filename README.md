# Hospital-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Microsoft Power BI)
## Project Objective
This Power BI project aims to provide an insightful Hospital Analytics Dashboard to analyze patient demographics, hospital performance, and department referrals. 
The key objectives include:
- Tracking total patient count and admission rates.
- Analyzing patient demographics by age, gender, race, and department referrals.
- Understanding trends in patient visits based on time (days, months, and years).
- Measuring hospital performance through KPIs like admission rate, wait time, and satisfaction rate.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/AlwinJesuraj23/power-BI-projects/blob/main/Location%20Table.csv">Dataset 1</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/AlwinJesuraj23/power-BI-projects/blob/main/Trip%20Details.xlsx">Dataset 2</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total number of patients for the selected year?
- What is the hospital admission rate compared to total patient visits?
- What is the average wait time for patients?
- How does patient distribution vary across different age groups and races?
- Which days of the week see the highest patient inflow?
- Which hospital departments receive the most referrals?
- What is the gender distribution of patients?

## Process
-** Data Collection: Gather raw patient data including admission status, age, gender, race, department referrals, wait times, and satisfaction scores.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Ensure data accuracy by handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and removing duplicates.

Data Modeling: Structure the dataset to create meaningful relationships and enable smooth visual representation in Power BI.

Dashboard Creation: Develop visualizations for KPIs using charts, graphs, and filters to improve usability.

Insights & Optimization: Analyze trends and refine visuals for better understanding and storytelling.

Deployment & Sharing: Publish the dashboard for stakeholders and decision-makers.

## Project Insight
- High-Demand Locations: Penn Station and Upper East Side are the top locations with the most trips.
- Peak Time: Most trips occur during late afternoon and early evening (peak hours).
- Payment Trends: Uber Pay dominates as the primary payment method.
- Day vs. Night: A majority of trips are conducted during the day (91.3%), with limited night shift activity (8.7%).
- Weekly Pattern: Weekdays (especially Monday to Friday) witness higher trip volumes compared to weekends.


## Final Conclusion:
The Uber Analytics dashboard highlights key operational metrics and trends essential for strategic decision-making. By understanding peak demand times, high-traffic locations, and preferred payment methods, Uber can:

- Optimize Resource Allocation: Deploy more drivers during peak hours and high-demand areas.
- Improve Customer Experience: Focus on efficient rides during peak hours and ensure better night shift coverage.
- Maximize Revenue: Target promotions in high-demand areas and incentivize preferred payment methods.
- This project demonstrates how business intelligence tools like Power BI can transform raw data into meaningful insights, empowering 
  businesses to make informed decisions.
