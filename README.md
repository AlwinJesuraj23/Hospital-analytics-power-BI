# Hospital-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Microsoft Power BI)
## 📌Project Objective
This Power BI project aims to provide an insightful Hospital Analytics Dashboard to analyze patient demographics, hospital performance, and department referrals. 
The key objectives include:
- Tracking total patient count and admission rates.
- Analyzing patient demographics by age, gender, race, and department referrals.
- Understanding trends in patient visits based on time (days, months, and years).
- Measuring hospital performance through KPIs like admission rate, wait time, and satisfaction rate.

## 📋Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/AlwinJesuraj23/Hospital-analytics-power-BI/blob/main/Hospital_ER_Dashboard_2021_2023_Final.csv">Dataset </a>

## ❔Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total number of patients for the selected year?
- What is the hospital admission rate compared to total patient visits?
- What is the average wait time for patients?
- How does patient distribution vary across different age groups and races?
- Which days of the week see the highest patient inflow?
- Which hospital departments receive the most referrals?
- What is the gender distribution of patients?

## 🎯 Project Insight
- **Peak Patient Visits**: The highest number of patient visits occur on Fridays and Saturdays.
  
- **Age Group Analysis**: The 60 & above age group has the highest patient count (485), followed by the 19 & below category (458).
  
- **Admission Trends**: The hospital's admission rate is 49.72%, indicating nearly half of the patients require hospital care.
  
- **Gender Distribution**: 57.24% of the patients are female, while 42.76% are male.
  
- **Top Departments**: The General Practice, Cardiology, and Neurology departments receive the most patient referrals.
  
- **Patient Racial Demographics**: The Native American patient group has the highest representation (306), followed by Pacific Islanders (295).

## 💡Final Conclusion:
This Power BI Hospital Analytics Dashboard provides an in-depth view of patient demographics, hospital efficiency, and referral trends. By leveraging these insights, hospital administrators can optimize resource allocation, improve patient satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency:

## 🚀Future Enhancement
